## What is Formium?

Formium is an **API-first, headless online form builder and automation tool** designed for high performance teams. In addition to hosting forms and surveys on [formium.io](https://formium.io), you can use your own React components to natively render your forms and surveys in your existing apps and websites. No iframes necessary.

## What Does this Directory Contain?

Each folder in this directory is an independent example of how to use Formium with various technologies and frameworks and component libraries. They can be run locally as well as be deployed to various hosting providers. To run the examples, you'll need to setup a `.env` file in each respective example. This step means that the examples, can't be instantly one-click deployed quite yet, but we'll be adding deploy buttons to streamline this process in the near future.
