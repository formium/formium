# Formium

Formium is an **API-first, headless online form builder and automation tool** designed for high performance teams. In addition to hosting forms and surveys on [formium.io](https://formium.io), you can use your own React components to natively render your forms and surveys in your existing apps and websites. No iframes necessary.
